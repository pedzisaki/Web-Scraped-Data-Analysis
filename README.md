# Web-Scraped-Data-Analysis
## Source: https://www.wikipedia.org/
#### This analysis looked at global economy data web scrapped from Wikipedia with the goal of answering the following questions:
1.	Which continents are represented in the top 20 countries with the highest market capitalization?
2.	What are the top exports for the top 20 countries with the highest market capitalization?
3.	Which of the valuable brands have stayed in the ranking in the 17-year period?
4.	What percentage are American companies in the largest private non-governmental companies?

#### Four dataframes were created from the following csv files and some will be used in combination to answer questions
1. brands -a ranking of brands in a 17 year time period
2. exports - top exports per country
3. marketcap- countries with with the top ranking market capitalization
4. private.co- a ranking of large privately owned companies in the world

#### Each csv file has its own jupyter notebook that details how the data was explored and analysed. Only 3 of the jupyter notebooks were used to answer the 4 questions as some questions required more than one data frame. Analysis and visualization will be found in the following notebooks:
* BrandRank.ipynb
* StockMarketRank.ipynb
* PrivateCoRank.ipynb
